            <p>The Metal Wizard is a web app that performs authentication on behalf of other apps. It is designed to be as simple as possible for developers to include in their apps, and also allows them to create complex single or multi-tenant authorization structures in its web UI, including creating tenants, groups, scopes, roles, and user invitations.</p>
